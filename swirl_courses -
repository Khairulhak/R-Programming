| This lesson is meant to be a short
| introduction to logical operations in R
...

| There are two logical values in R, also
| called boolean values. They are TRUE and
| FALSE. In R you can construct logical
| expressions which will evaluate to either
| TRUE or FALSE.
...

| Many of the questions in this lesson will
| involve evaluating logical expressions.
| It may be useful to open up a second R
| terminal where you can experiment with
| some of these expressions.
...

| Creating logical expressions requires
| logical operators. You're probably
| familiar with arithmetic operators like
| `+`, `-`, `*`, and `/`. The first logical
| operator we are going to discuss is the
| equality operator, represented by two
| equals signs `==`. Use the equality
| operator below to find out if TRUE is
| equal to TRUE.
...
 correct answer : TRUE == TRUE
